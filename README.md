## Question 1: SVM

### Part A
The file "/SVM/svm.py" creates a Support Vector Machine class that implements the soft margin SVM classification algorithm.

### Part B
The file "/SVM/b.py" answers the question. 200 positively labeled points are generated, and 200 negatively labeled points are generated. Then, the SVM class created for Part A is trained on the data, and then the visualize function is called to plot the data and the decision boundary.
1. What are the support vectors?
  - Don't know
2. What is the margin?
  - Not sure
3. Compute the leave-one-out validation error.
  - I'll try
4.  Vary the tradeoff parameter C between the misclassification error and the margin; plot the decision boundary for different values of C.
  - Sure

### Part C
The file "/SVM/c.py" answers this question. The generalization error is as follows:
- Oops
