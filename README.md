## Question 1: SVM

### Part A
The file "/SVM/svm.py" creates a Support Vector Machine class that implements the soft margin SVM classification algorithm.

### Part B
The file "/SVM/b.py" answers the question. 200 positively labeled points are generated, and 200 negatively labeled points are generated. Then, the SVM class created for Part A is trained on the data, and then the visualize function is called to plot the data and the decision boundary.
All the questions are answered at the bottom of the code.

### Part C
The file "/SVM/c.py" answers this question. The generalization error is as follows:
- Oops
